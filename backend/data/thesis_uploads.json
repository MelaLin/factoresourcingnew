The research focuses on photovoltaic \n        technology, energy storage solutions, and integration with existing building \n        management systems. Key areas of investigation include:\n        \n        1. Solar panel efficiency and placement optimization\n        2. Battery storage systems for commercial applications\n        3. Grid integration and net metering strategies\n        4. Economic feasibility and return on investment\n        5. Environmental impact assessment\n        \n        The goal is to provide a comprehensive framework for commercial building owners \n        to implement solar energy solutions effectively.",
